# Project

Project is an end to end multi-class image classifier using TensorFlow 2.0 and TensorFlow Hub.
It identifies the breed of the dog given an image of dog.
When I'm sitting in a cafe and I took a photo of the dog as I want to know the breed of the dog. This project will help me to identify the dog breed.
